# A Plus health

The Idea is to build a web application for health monitoring and diagnostics system where the patient can come to our site and know about his health and if he is ill or not healthy then he can book appointments to the doctors available and can consult them online if the doctor figures out that the problem is not severe and can be cured at home then appropriate measures will be made otherwise he needs to take other measures.
